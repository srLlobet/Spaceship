<h1>Spaceship</h1>

<h2>Move the ship around! A simple 3D game made with my own engine!</h2>

<h3>Basic Player Controls: Click and hold the mouse to look around and reposition the ship. 
                           SPACE - move forwards      
                           CTRL - move backwards        
                           W and S - pitch axis    
                           A and D - yaw axis   </h3>

<h3>The game features my first dabble into a 3D game made in pure c++ without an engine. It's certainly not perfect, but it was a great experience to familiarize myself with adding 3D meshes in an engine.</h3>
